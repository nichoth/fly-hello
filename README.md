This depends on a CLI, `flyctl`, which is a `brew` dependency, so not provided by `npm`.

## A Fly Example

This is a simple application used in the [fly.io Getting Started](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/node/)  documentation showing how to deploy a Node application using Flyctl's builtin Nodejs deployment option.

* Run flyctl init
* When prompted for a builder, select builtin Nodejs.
* Run flyctl deploy
